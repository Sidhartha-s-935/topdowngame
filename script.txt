<TEXT Renders in black screen>

It's been a week since I woke up. A week since the doctors told me I was in a coma. A week since they said my memories are... damaged. Selective amnesia, they called it. I don't remember the accident. I don't remember the months leading up to it. All I know is... she's gone. And no one can tell me where.

<visuals fade out to MC's home>

*MC is standing at a corner staring at his wife's portrait*

Player: "I can't keep doing this. Staring at the same photos, over and over. It’s all fragments... Pieces of a life I can barely remember"

*MC walks to the other end of the room towards a glowing device shaped like an tablet*

Player: *reaches out, fingers tracing the cold, metallic surface of the machine*
        *clicks and clacks as types in a date* 
        "If my memories are still out there, scattered like broken glass... then I’ll find them. One piece at a time."

*Presses the button the screen fades into a blinding white light*
